                *As browsers launch thier latest versions, 
                there are features that they add to make it better that the former one. <br>
                One of this features is Zooming ability. Browser allow us to zoom the 
                specific page we are observing. As a developer, <br> there are a lot of methods
                 used to make a website responsive to the size of the browser that it is 
                 being  observed .Out <br> of these methods,  using Media Queris and using %,em,rem
                  are most frequent ones.Using em,rem gives our website <br> a flexibility.
                  The browser renders a certain value of em or rem into anything between 16px-160px
                  depending on <br> the of screen available at the moment of observance.since it is the browser that is
                  doing the adjestment task, in my <br> opinion, it is a good idea to use this features for responsiveness problem.

                A web page isn’t a single entity that is downloaded and displayed on screen one pixel at a time. Instead it is <br>
                 essentially a series of instructions written in various types of code — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP  <br>
                  . It tell the browser what and how to do it. Each browser uses a rendering engine, also called <br> 
                   layout engine, to take the content and styling information contained within the code, and display <br> it on screen in its fully formatted form.

                *CSS3 were published on 7 June 2011. When it were published, 
                it came across with some technical changes. <br> Some of this changes 
                are:- <br> - BOX-SHADOW: this feature adds a shadow to an element, i.e 
                at the background of the box shadow with will be added. <br> - OPACITY: specifies 
                how transparent an element is. The opacity level numbered from 0-1. When the level
                 is 0,it means <br> that the element is completly invisible. But when the level equals 
                 1,it means the element is completly solid and visible. <br> -ROUNDED-CORNER: this feature
                  makes a boarder of an element circle. <br> - ATTRIBUTE-SELECTORS: this feature adds additional
                  selectors also avoid the need of ID's and CLASS's for styling them. <br> - NEW-COLORS: CSS3 adds
                   some additionalcolors and way of assigning them. Eg:HSLA,Gradiant colors,HSL,RGBA.
