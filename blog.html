                at the background of the box shadow with will be added. <br> - OPACITY: specifies 
                how transparent an element is. The opacity level numbered from 0-1. When the level
                 is 0,it means <br> that the element is completly invisible. But when the level equals 
                 1,it means the element is completly solid and visible. <br> -ROUNDED-CORNER: this feature
                  makes a boarder of an element circle. <br> - ATTRIBUTE-SELECTORS: this feature adds additional
